# Solutions to LeetCode Problems

This repo contains my solutions (exclusively in C++) for Leetcode problems. All the solutions have been tested and pass the Leetcode time and memory constraints; however, this does not mean the solution is of optimal time complexity. In several files, both a slower and faster solution are presented.

Issues/In Progress:
| # | Title | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1169.cpp | Invalid Transactions | Solution is possible in $\mathcal O(N \log N)$, too lazy to implement|
| 307.cpp | Range Sum Query - Mutable | TODO, segment tree/BST |
| 135.cpp | Candy | Possible in one pass, still $\mathcal O(N)$ but much faster|
