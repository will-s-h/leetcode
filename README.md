# Solutions to LeetCode Problems

This repo contains my solutions (exclusively in C++) for Leetcode problems. All the solutions have been tested and pass the Leetcode time and memory constraints; however, this does not mean the solution is of optimal time complexity. In several files, both a slower and faster solution are presented.

Issues/In Progress:
| # | Title | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| [1169.cpp](https://leetcode.com/problems/invalid-transactions/) | Invalid Transactions | Solution is possible in $\mathcal O(N \log N)$, too lazy to implement |
| [135.cpp](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy/) | Candy | Possible in one pass, still $\mathcal O(N)$ but much faster |
| [39.cpp](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/) | Combination Sum | Could be faster??? |
| [229.cpp](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/) | Majority Element II | Take time to understand Boyer-Moore Majority Algorithm, see [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/discuss/543672/BoyerMoore-majority-vote-algorithm-EXPLAINED) |
